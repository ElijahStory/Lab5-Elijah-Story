# Lab5

# Setup
The hardware set up is the same for both parts, so it will just be listed once here.

POWER is coming from pin 13. The POWER goes into the breadboard to the POSITIVE leg of an LED, down the NEGATIVE leg through the breadboard and back into the UNO at the GROUND.

## Part2
File Lab5_MorseCode_ElijahS, blinks morse code for a sentence set in the code.
The serial port is used to make it easier to understand what is happening.

I don't have any ideas at the moment on projects. I was introduced to the idea of a useless machine recently and then again in the videos we watched in the lab and I think that could be a fun project I might try at some point. I also really like the LED cubes that are programmed to dance.
